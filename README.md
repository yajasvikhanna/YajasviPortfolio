Welcome to my personal portfolio! Here, you can explore details about me, my skills, and the projects I've worked on. If you'd like to personalize this portfolio, you can easily modify the `src/pages/index.tsx` and `src/styles/globals.css` files to reflect your own unique style. Feel free to make improvements and share them with a pull request. If you encounter any issues, you can report them here.

## üéâ Features

- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is fully responsive and optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring an excellent experience on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Easy Customization**: The project structure is simple and organized, making it easy to personalize and tailor the portfolio to showcase your skills, experience, and projects.
- **Modern UI/UX**: A sleek, modern design that offers smooth animations to create an engaging experience for potential employers and clients.
- **Interactive UI**: The portfolio incorporates advanced web techniques, such as `locomotive-scroll` and `framer-motion`, to provide a smooth and interactive user experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure that you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: This is required to run the development server and install dependencies. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Node's package manager is necessary for installing dependencies. It comes with Node.js, so you don‚Äôt need to install it separately.
- **git**: If you're planning to clone this repository, make sure git is installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/).

### üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Open a terminal window and clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/YajasviPortfolio.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   After cloning the repo, change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd YajasviPortfolio
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install all the necessary dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**  
   After installing the dependencies, start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the server at `http://localhost:3000`, and you can open your browser to see your portfolio live locally.

5. **Modify the Portfolio**  
   - To update the content of your portfolio, edit `src/pages/index.tsx` where the main content is located.
   - You can style your portfolio by editing the CSS in `src/styles/globals.css`.

### How to Make Changes

- **Change the Content**: To modify the content such as the "About Me" section, projects, or any other information, simply navigate to `src/pages/index.tsx` and make your edits. This is where the main data is rendered.
  
- **Update Styling**: To customize the design and layout, head over to `src/styles/globals.css` and make adjustments to the styles according to your preferences.
